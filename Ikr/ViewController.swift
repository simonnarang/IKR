You wouldnt want people snaping pictures of you like some animal in a zoo (hopefully)", "Colonal Snaders made surprise visits to KFC ''restaurants''. If dissatisfied with the food he threw it to the floor while cursing out the cashiers", "A new spa house in Japan has partenered with Ramen Noodles, those things you buy cheap at the grocery store and binge eat when your tired from work. The spa uses the noodles to give customers nooodle baths in hot tubs filed with chicken broth", "A person cannot taste food unless it is mixed with saliva. For example, if strong-tasting substance like salt is placed on a dry tongue, the taste buds will not be able to taste it. As soon as a drop of saliva is added and the salt is dissolved, however, a definite taste sensation results. This is true for all foods. Try it!", "The reason firehouses have circular stairways is from the days of yore when the engines were pulled by horses. The horses were stabled on the ground floor and figured out how to walk up straight staircases.", "The rock at the summit of mount everest is marine limestone, acording to science it should have been deposited on the seafloor around 450 million years ago, yet it still lies up there, maybe Stephan Hawking was wrong afterall", "Mobile phone throwing is an offical sport in finland. (No elaboration needed)", "Microsoft has calculated that our attention span in 2015 is just 8 seconds. It was 12 seconds in the year 2000. The average teacher is 50 years old and says the average attention span in 1990 was 14 seconds... Ouch!", "If you collected the poop from 1 million Americans and mined it for metals, you'd make $13 million a year."]
